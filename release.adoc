= Releasing Camel Dashboard operator

[[releasing-software]]
== Software required to release

* `git` CLI
* Docker and DockerX tooling
* https://www.qemu.org/[QEMU] - required to emulate ARM64 build

[[arm64-verify]]
=== Verify if your machine can build an ARM64 container image

As suggested above, you may need to install some software to be able to build an ARM64 based image. You can verify that with:

```
docker buildx ls | grep arm
```

NOTE: if you don't list any available builder, if you're on Ubuntu, you can install quickly QEMU via `sudo apt-get install -y qemu qemu-user-static` and retry to list the ARM64 based builders afterward.

[[release-process]]
== Release Process

Notes to be further developed:

* Create a new `release-a.b.x` (ie, `release-0.0.x`) branch from `main` at the point of release cut.
* Bump the version to the desired version to cut: `make bump VERSION=0.0.1`
* Prepare the Helm chart: `make release-helm`
* Push the release branch
* Create a tag with the version you want to cut as `vx.y.z` (ie, `v0.0.1`) --> will trigger a Github action pushing the operator container image to Quay.io
* Finalize the release
